__Mission Statement__

Providing more communities information towards a healthier lifestyle for themselves and their loved ones.

__Problem Statement__

While information surrounding health and nutrition might appear as prominent as ever due to technology and communication platforms, misinformation and disinformation on health and nutrition continues to predominantly impact communities of color and minorities. Without accurate information access, these groups encounter greater disparities in quality of life and risk shortened lifespans. Compounded with structural forms of oppression such as race and income, individuals from such communities oftentimes lack access to culturally appropriate materials and education that emphasize healthy nutrition habits.

This problem coincides with how minority communities may tend to mistrust information if the sources are not directly connected to the community, such as on larger government or institution levels. While there are existing solutions to address accurate health information, such as sites like nutrition.gov, their information tends to not be culturally sensitive or include accessible ideas that communities of color feel personally connected to. Given this current context, how might we improve accurate, culturally relevant, and accessible information for underrepresented minority communities to promote trust in building healthy and nutritious lifestyles?
