# Problem Statement

While information surrounding nutrition might appear as prominent as ever due to technology and communication platforms, lack of accurate, personalized nutrition information continues to predominantly impact teenagers and young adults in minority communities. Without adequate access to nutritional education and healthy diet, low-income communities of color encounter greater disparities in quality of life, lifespan, and/or disease incidences[[1]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2729116/). A couple user interviews from individuals of these communities and with Public Health backgrounds reveal that main causes of the problem root from lack of time to sift through nutritional information suited for their needs, as many are busy with other pressing needs such as work to sustain their income. Additionally, for both busy individuals and teenagers, some nutritional content is not as accessible such as the language of lengthy, difficult academic sources, leaving minimal options for visually understandable and concise information.

While there are existing solutions to address accurate nutrition information and meal plans, like nutrition.gov and ChooseMyPlate, their information is not fully personalized towards an individualâ€™s current situation and demographic, such as culturally competent and affordable options that communities of color may feel more personally connected to. Given this current context, how might we bring accurate, straightforward, and personalized nutrition information for underrepresented minority teenagers/young adults to improve knowledge on nutritious habits?

We believe in creating a solution that meets the stakeholder where they are at in their health journey. As such we have created a figma webpage that displays what our solution design could possibly look like. The goal of our product is not only to inform the individual(s) but also give them the tools to succeed not just for today, but tomorrow and beyond, leading to lasting nutritional change for a more robust and healthy lifestyle.

The first step is to collect some information, notably, we announce we are only using this for their purposes of using the app, and nothing more. We take their height and weight and name.

This is the real meat and potatoes (pun intended), as we want to again come to where they are to help advise and procure items to switch to possibly eating that they are familiar with. So we are attempting to learn about their culture. They select what type of food they eat.
