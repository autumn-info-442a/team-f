# Problem Statement

While information surrounding nutrition might appear as prominent as ever due to technology and communication platforms, lack of accurate, personalized nutrition information continues to predominantly impact teenagers and young adults in minority communities. Without adequate access to nutritional education and healthy diet, low-income communities of color encounter greater disparities in quality of life, lifespan, and/or disease incidences[[1]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2729116/). A couple user interviews from individuals of these communities and with Public Health backgrounds reveal that main causes of the problem root from lack of time to sift through nutritional information suited for their needs, as many are busy with other pressing needs such as work to sustain their income. Additionally, for both busy individuals and teenagers, some nutritional content is not as accessible such as the language of lengthy, difficult academic sources, leaving minimal options for visually understandable and concise information.

While there are existing solutions to address accurate nutrition information and meal plans, like nutrition.gov and ChooseMyPlate, their information is not fully personalized towards an individual’s current situation and demographic, such as culturally competent and affordable options that communities of color may feel more personally connected to. Given this current context, how might we bring accurate, straightforward, and personalized nutrition information for underrepresented minority teenagers/young adults to improve knowledge on nutritious habits?

# Solution Statement


## Overview of Fresh Take ##
Our solution supports teenagers and young adults in minority communities who may have limited experience in building nutritious habits and lifestyles, but would like to learn more. This is implemented in a form of a personalized plan where a user submits their information in an engaging survey, which is then calculated to provide nutritional recommendations, curated nutrition tips, and culturally relevant meals. The web application interface is as follows:

<br></br>

### Landing Page ###
![LandingPage](/img/1_home.png)

### Navigation Bar ###
The nav bar is shown on every screen of the interface. The Fresh Take logo is contained in its own box, hyperlinked to this landing page URL. For the About and Project Menu tabs, each tab container should be highlighted when hovering over it.

Create Plan banner card: Card should be responsive to size changes, but should still have the photo/text (“Personalize your nutrition…” above the Create Plan button at all times. Only the Create Plan button should be clickable, and it will lead you to the first page of the survey.

Info/quote/testimonial cards: On desktop port these cards should be aligned horizontally, but when reducing the viewport on a smaller device the cards may be stacked vertically. Photos should be included on the top part of the card, but if there is no photo the card will default to a preselected blank placeholder. It should be view-only and not clickable.
Popular meal cards: A maximum of 6 popular meals should be shown on the home page at once. If a user wants to see more meals, they can click the Popular Meals tab in the nav bar or a Show More button that will be designed at the bottom of the 6 meal previews to redirect to the Popular Meals page. Each meal card redirects to an external hyperlink showing the recipe.

Some more personal information just so we can assist them better.

This is the real meat and potatoes (pun intended), as we want to again come to where they are to help advise and procure items to switch to possibly eating that they are familiar with. So we are attempting to learn about their culture. They select what type of food they eat.

This is the final part that will give them full information according to the data we will load in to help provide recipes and tips for them to incorporate in their lifestyle and allow a lot of interaction to learn.
