Correctness - While information is accessible, it also needs to have correct health information so users are not misinformed
Usability - All users are able to interact and use the platform without any complications
Bias - It's important to be inclusive and not stereotype or generalize our product and users especially since our product is intended to reach typically underrepresented groups and cultures.
